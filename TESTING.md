# How to Test the Bloom Application

This document provides a step-by-step guide for testing the features of the Bloom application using the interactive demo mode.

## 1. Accessing the Demo

1.  Navigate to the application's login page.
2.  Instead of entering credentials, click the **"Try Interactive Demo"** button.
3.  You will be redirected to the main dashboard, pre-populated with sample data for a fictional user, Anastasia, a social media manager.

A banner at the top of the screen will confirm you are in demo mode. **Note:** Any changes you make in the demo are temporary and will be reset if you refresh the page or click the "Reset Demo" button.

## 2. Exploring Key Features

Follow this guided tour to understand the core functionality of Bloom.

### The Dashboard

-   **Location**: The first page you see after entering the demo.
-   **What to look for**:
    -   **Statistic Cards**: At the top, you'll see cards summarizing Anastasia's average completion rates for daily, weekly, and monthly goals, as well as her habit tracking score.
    -   **Lifetime Stats**: Further down, view lifetime totals for goals met and people contacted.
    -   **AI Productivity Analysis**: At the bottom, read the AI-generated summary of Anastasia's recent progress. Click "View Detailed Analysis" to see a more in-depth breakdown in a pop-up dialog.

### The "My Core" Section

This section is about defining high-level ambition and vision.

1.  **My Ambition**:
    -   **Location**: Navigate via the sidebar under "My Core".
    -   **What to test**:
        -   Click through the carousel to see the 5 "metrics" that define success for Anastasia.
        -   Notice how the "facets" (e.g., "Career", "Finance") associated with each metric are displayed as badges.

2.  **Persona Definition**:
    -   **Location**: Sidebar -> My Core -> Persona Definition.
    -   **What to look for**:
        -   This page shows Anastasia's "Why" (her reasons), her "Who" (the traits she wants to embody), and her personal philosophies. All fields are pre-populated with sample data.

3.  **Life Vision**:
    -   **Location**: Sidebar -> My Core -> Life Vision.
    -   **What to test**:
        -   Examine the "Decade Milestones" section to see her long-term goals.
        -   Review the "My 5-Year Vision" section, where her answers to specific prompts create a detailed picture of her future.
        -   Check the "5-Year Vision Statement" at the bottom, which summarizes her goal in a concise sentence.

4.  **My Big Goal**:
    -   **Location**: Sidebar -> My Core -> My Big Goal.
    -   **What to test**:
        -   On the left, you'll see her measurable 12-month goal.
        -   On the right, you can click the **"Analyze Goal"** button to see a sample AI-powered SMART analysis of that goal.

### The "My Plans" Section

This is where the high-level vision is broken down into actionable plans.

-   **Monthly Goals, Month Planner, Week Planner, Daily Plan**:
    -   **Location**: Navigate to each of these pages via the sidebar under "My Plans".
    -   **What to look for**:
        -   Each page is filled with detailed, sample data that shows how Anastasia plans her year, month, week, and day.
        -   Notice how the goals cascade down (e.g., the "Big Goal for the YEAR" from the previous section appears on the "Month Planner" page).
        -   On the **Daily Plan** page, use the arrow buttons at the top right to navigate between different days and see how the plan changes.

### AI-Powered Features

1.  **AI Reflection**:
    -   **Location**: Navigate to "AI Reflection" from the sidebar.
    -   **What to test**:
        -   Click the **"Generate Reflection"** button. A sample AI reflection will appear on the right, split into "Summary" and "Detailed" tabs. This demonstrates how the AI analyzes user data to provide feedback.

2.  **AI Interview**:
    -   **Note**: The AI Interview feature, which uses your microphone, is best experienced in a real, logged-in account. In the demo, its functionality is limited.
    -   You can see the **"Start AI Interview"** button on all of the "My Plans" pages (e.g., Daily Plan, Week Planner). In a real account, this would initiate a voice conversation to fill out the page content automatically.
